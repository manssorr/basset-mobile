Basset (translates to simple in Arabic) is a free open source FFmpeg GUI utility.
<br/>
its goals are:

<center>
Simplicity and ease ✨ - Speed ⚡ - Privacy 🔏
</center>

This is Basset's Mobile version; after seeing how impactful Basset desktop was, and how many people benefited from it, I thought a Mobile Basset version (built using React native/Expo) was very important.. so here it is..
Keep in mind I wasn't able to test Basset across different screen resolution and different Android Versions; so Basset is definitely prone to bugs.
